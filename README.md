# Optimal Air Route Research Project Calculations

This repository contains the calculations developed as part of the study for the "Optimal Air Route Research Project". The primary focus of this project is to explore efficient routing strategies in the context of air travel, optimizing for factors like distance, time, and possibly fuel consumption.
The included Python script performs a series of calculations to determine optimal routes under specified constraints. It utilizes nested loops and mathematical calculations to evaluate different route scenarios and identify the most efficient path.
